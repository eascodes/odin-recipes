    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is an amazing banana bread recipe from a popular blog called <a href="https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/">The Salty Marshmallow</a>. The recipe is my favorite
            because it has never failed to result in mouth-watering, buttery, ask-for-another-slice deliciousness. My grandparents go nuts for it. I also love it because it
            uses simple ingredients that I usually already have stocked in my kitchen. Any time my bananas start to get overripe, BAM! I can whip this bad boy up and reap the 
            heavenly rewards of warm, buttery smells permeating my entire home.

            <ol>

                <li>Add the bananas to the same bowl and mash with a fork.</li>
                <li>Add the vanilla extract and egg to the bowl and use the same fork to mash and stir until no yellow streaks of egg remain.
                </li>
                <li>In a second large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
                <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix together with a spatula just until combined.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into prepared loaf pan and bake for 45-55 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.</li>
            </ol>
