    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Looking for a versatile breakfast recipe? Try this vegetable egg bake from <a href="https://www.a-kitchen-addiction.com/">A Kitchen Addiction</a>. I think I've made it at least 30 times, and most of the time I vary the ingredients slightly depending on what's in season or in my kitchen. It comes out beautifully and keeps well in the fridge throughout the week. It's also a fantastic breakfast to serve for a crowd!
